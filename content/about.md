It has been some years since I wrote a blog, having spent some time helping write a book two years ago, [Docker in Production](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9781939902184.do) and having written in various other places. But I like writing so I am going to start again.

The title comes from [Eduardo Paolozzi's 1971 series of etchings](http://www.tate.org.uk/art/search?gid=65448&type=artwork) about robots, spaceflight and kids toys.

I am mostly going to write about software, cloud, atomicity, but no doubt some other things too.

I work at Docker in Cambridge, UK. You can [find me on twitter](https://twitter.com/justincormack).
